# Team and areas

Who owns which part of this repo. Skills read this to label issues with an area and to assign owners.

## Areas

An **area** is a part of the product with one owner. Its label is `area:<app>` or, when an app has several owners, `area:<app>:<part>`. Every epic has exactly one area; everything under the epic inherits it.

| Area | Label | Code | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Web app | `area:web` | not built yet | Core |
| Mobile app | `area:mobile` | not built yet | Core |
| Marketing | `area:marketing` | not built yet | Core |

**Code** is where the area lives (a folder, or "not built yet"), so an agent can tell an issue's area from the files it touches.

## Teams

Each member: GitHub handle, then what they do. The description settles what the table can't: the default person for a team, and what they don't take.

### Core

- **@imick-io**: founder; builds everything (web app, mobile app, marketing). Default for all work.

## Assignment

The assignee means *claimed*. Initiatives and epics are assigned to the area owner's default person; `ready-for-human` work to whoever will do it; map tickets and `ready-for-agent` tickets stay unassigned until claimed.
